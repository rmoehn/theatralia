# theatralia

The project uses [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/).

## How to run the tests

`lein midje` will run all tests.

`lein midje namespace.*` will run only tests beginning with "namespace.".

`lein midje :autotest` will run all the tests indefinitely. It sets up a
watcher on the code files. If they change, only the relevant tests will be
run again.

## Notes from the start

I looked at current ways to set up a Clojure web application. The most
prominent thing applicable to this application (mainly server-side
stuff) appeared [Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/). It claims to be
minimal, but when I look at the Leiningen template, it still sets up a
lot of stuff that I'd like to set up step by step. Additionally it talks
about some things I wouldn't use in my project, most prominently Selmer
for templating and non-Datomic databases. It doesn't talk about Datomic
anywhere, which makes me suspicious. However, Luminus looks like a good
orientation for some things, so probably it will will appear in the
[Credits section](#credits).

A second thing you should know is Stuart Sierra's
[component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) framework.

## CSS

For now I'm trying CSS generation with
[Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden). However, since I don't know much
about CSS, it might be quicker to use some framework. I will have a look at
[YAML](http://www.yaml.de/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

## Credits <a name="credits"></a>

The previous section already named some resources I used for my work. Most of
the source files will also contain a Credits section referencing places on the
web (mainly), where I found snippets or hints about how to write a particular
piece of code.

## How to test on a local Tomcat

 1. Run `lein ring uberwar`.
 2. Copy `target/theatralia.war` to your Tomcat's webapps directory, probably
    `/var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/`.
 3. Restart Tomcat.
 4. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/theatralia. If Tomcat listens on
    a different port, you have to use that, of course.

## Tags and versioning

`.travis.yml` specifies that every tagged commit gets deployed to GitHub
Releases (and eventually to the web server). Commits that are not tagged don't
get deployed. I'm too lazy to write a full new version number for every version
I want to deploy for testing, so tags will be `t<number>`.
